# Contributing Guidelines

## Introduction
Firstly, thank you for considering contributing to IceCream! It's people like you that make the open source community great! 😊

We welcome any types of contribution, not only code. You can help by

- **Q&A**: file issues that you're facing. The more detailed, the better. Offering the steps that can reproduce the issue is the best.
- **Marketing**: writing blogs or posts, howto's and ...
- **Code**: take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/caiyue1993/IceCream/issues). Even if you couldn't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It really helps.
- **Money**: maintaining a active project takes time and much effort. We welcome [financial support](https://github.com/caiyue1993/IceCream#donation).
