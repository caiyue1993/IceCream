- [x] Manually Synchronization is also supported
- [x] User Account Status Check
- [ ] Complete Documentation 

## Prerequisite
1. Be sure to have enrolled in Apple Developer Program

2. Turn on your iCloud in Capabilities and choose `CloudKit`

3. Turn on Background Modes and check `Background fetch` and `Remote notification` 

## Usage

### Basics
1. Prepare your Realm Object(e.g. Dog)
```swift
class Dog: Object {
    @objc dynamic var id = NSUUID().uuidString
    @objc dynamic var name = ""
    @objc dynamic var age = 0
    @objc dynamic var isDeleted = false

    static let AVATAR_KEY = "avatar"
    @objc dynamic var avatar: CreamAsset?

    override class func primaryKey() -> String? {
        return "id"
    }
}
```

2. Do stuffs like that
```swift
extension Dog: CKRecordConvertible {
    // Yep, leave it blank!    
}

```
Is that easy? Protocol Extensions do this trick.

3. Start the Engine!
```swift
var syncEngine: ObjectSyncEngine?
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    ...
    syncEngine = ObjectSyncEngine(privateObjectTypes: [Dog.self])
    syncEngine.start()
    application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
    ...
}
```

4. Listen for remote notifications
> The sample code in [AppDelegate](https://github.com/caiyue1993/IceCream/blob/master/Example/IceCream/AppDelegate.swift) will be a good reference.

That's all you need to do! Everytime you write to Realm, the SyncEngine will get notified and handle sync stuffs!

For more details, clone the project to see the source code.

### Object Deletions

Yep, we highly recommend you use **Soft Deletions**. That's why we add a `isDeleted` property to CKRecordConvertible protocol. 

When you want to delete a object, you just need to set its `isDeleted` property to true. And the rest of things are already taken care of.

*You also don't need to worry about the clean-up things. It has also been considered.*

### How about syncing asset? 
Luckily, we have a perfect solution for syncing asset. 
Absolutely, you could also store your image or kind of resource stuff as `Data` type and everything works fine. But Realm has a [16MB limit](https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#current-limitations) of data property. And CloudKit encourages us to use `CKAsset` in places where the data you want to assign to a field is more than a few kilobytes in size.
So taking the consideration of the above two, we recommend you to use `CreamAsset` property to hold data. `CreamAsset` will store local data on the file system and just save file paths in the Realm, all automatically. And we'll wrap things up to upload to CloudKit as `CKAsset`. 

Example project is provided to see the detailed usage.

## Requirements

- iOS 10.0+
- Swift 4
- Realm Swift ~> 3.0

## Debug Suggestions

It's true that debugging CloudKit is hard and tedious. But I have some tips for you guys when facing puzzles.

- You should know how Realm and CloudKit works. 
- Using GUI tools, like [Realm Browser](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/realm-browser/id1007457278?mt=12) and [CloudKit Dashboard](https://icloud.developer.apple.com/dashboard).
- When you are lost and don't remember where you are, I suggest starting all over again. In CloudKit Dashboard, "Reset..." button is provided. You can also
clear local database by re-install apps.
- By default, IceCream only prints some logs to your console in DEBUG mode. However, you could turn it off by adding `IceCream.shared.enableLogging = false` if it bothers you.
- Keep calm and carry on!

*Warning: If you're going to launch your app onto App Store, don't forget to deploy your environment settings to production. You can do it easily in the CloudKit Dashboard. Write & Read permissions are also need to be considered.*

### One More Tip
How to debug CloudKit in production mode? See this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30182521/use-production-cloudkit-during-development).

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

Using Carthage or CocoaPods.

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager for Cocoa application.

To integrate IceCream into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "caiyue1993/IceCream"
```

Then, run the following command to build the frameworks:

```bash
$ carthage update
```

Normally you'll get IceCream, Realm and RealmSwift frameworks. You need to set up your Xcode project manually to add these 3 frameworks.

On your application targets’ **General** settings tab, in the **Linked Frameworks and Libraries** section, drag and drop each framework to use from the `Carthage/Build` folder on disk.

On your application targets’ **Build Phases** settings tab, click the “+” icon and choose “New Run Script Phase”. Create a Run Script with the following content:

```
/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
```

and add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under “Input Files”:

```
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/IceCream.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Realm.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/RealmSwift.framework
```

For more information about how to use Carthage, please see its [project page](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

### CocoaPods

IceCream is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'IceCream', '~> 1.3.0'
```
